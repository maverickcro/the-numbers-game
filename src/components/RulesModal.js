          Welcome to "The Numbers Game" â€“ a test of skill and luck! Your goal is
          to place random numbers into a grid in ascending order. Sounds easy?
          Think again!
        </p>
        <p>
          You can only place a number if it fits logically within the sequence.
          One wrong move, and it's game over!
        </p>
        <p>
          Customize your game with Jokers and different grid sizes in Settings.
